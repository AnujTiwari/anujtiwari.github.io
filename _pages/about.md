Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am Research Associate in the [Discovery Partners Institute, University of Illinois Systems, Chicago](https://dpi.uillinois.edu/), and a Visiting Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Center for Water Research at the Northwestern University, Evanston, USA](https://water.northwestern.edu/).

I earned my Ph.D in Semantically enriched 3D City Modeling from the
[Indian Institute *of* Technology Roorkee, India]([https://iitr.ac.in/]), 
M.Tech in Spatial Information Technology from [DAVV University, Indore, India](https://www.dauniv.ac.in/) 
and my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from [RGPV University, Bhopal, India](https://www.rgpv.ac.in/).
My research interests include Geographic Information System (GIS), Urban Remote Sensing, Data Sciences 
(Machine and Deep Learning), Public health and Epidemiology.
