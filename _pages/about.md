Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am Research Associate in the [Discovery Partners Institute, University of Illinois Systems, Chicago](https://dpi.uillinois.edu/), and a Visiting Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Center for Water Research at the Northwestern University, Evanston, USA](https://water.northwestern.edu/).

I earned my Ph.D in Semantically enriched 3D City Modeling from the
[Indian Institute *of* Technology Roorkee, India]([https://iitr.ac.in/]), 
Master’s degree in Spatial Information Technology from DAVV University, Indore, India 
and my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from RGPV University, Bhopal, India.
My current research (Postdoc) applies a combination of geospatial and computational approaches to quantitatively understand decision-making in wastewater sampling and data interpretation with a focus on questions in Wastewater Epidemiology, Pandemic Vulnerability Modeling, and Health-GIS. My research interests include Natural Disasters (forest fire, sinkhole, avalanche, urban heating etc) and Health Hazards (chemical, physical, and biological) Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, Urban Remote Sensing, and Computational Medical Research.

My long term goal is to use rigorous research methodology to generate scientific knowledge, and inform the development of effective, efficient, and culturally tailored interventions to decease the burden of both the health hazards and the natural disasters on underrepresented populations.
