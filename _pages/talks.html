<h1>COVID-19 Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE)</h1>
Wastewater Based Epidemiology (WBE) typically focuses on wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and the corresponding community. However, many public health questions require insight across many communities such as at the county or state level. What is the optimal sampling strategy in regions such as rural counties with dozens of treatment plants and private septic systems, or in entire states with many such counties? The State of Illinois is a primarily rural region comprising 58k square miles with a population of roughly 16M, over half of whom live within 50 miles of Chicago. Outside of the Chicago area, Illinois has roughly 140 cities with populations greater than 10k and nearly 1,000 with populations under 10k. To understand and track infectious disease such as COVID-19 across these communities, a comprehensive WBE sampling plan would involve over 1,000 WWTPs and countless private septic systems. In Sep 2020, we introduced a machine learning-based COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (C19VI) using CDC’s six themes: (a) socioeconomic status, (b) household composition & disability, (c) minority status & language, (d) housing type & transportation, (e) epidemiological factors, and (e) healthcare system factors . This model uses an ensemble learning approach with recursive partitioning to optimally compute non-linear relationships between input themes. We refined the model in early 2021 with additional demographic and sequencing information to evaluate WBE sampling strategies across Illinois counties to support an expansion of WBE from currently several dozen to over 150 WWTPs. The vulnerability index supported the evaluation of various sampling strategies, such as selecting the largest population centers within each of the eleven COVID-19 “Restore Illinois” regions , and eventually the current strategy of sampling from the largest population center in each of Illinois’ 102 counties. In this poster we outline the models and methods used, including various sampling strategies explored, the current strategy, and experiments planned to evaluate the sampling strategy as we expand to 150 WWTPs in 2021.

<h1>COVID-19 Vulnerability Modeling</h1>

COVID-19 is now one of the most leading causes of death in the United States (US). Systemic health, social and economic disparities have put the minorities and economically poor communities at a higher risk than others. There is an immediate requirement to develop a reliable measure of county-level vulnerabilities that can capture the heterogeneity of vulnerable communities. This study reports a COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (C19VI) for identifying and mapping vulnerable counties. We proposed a Random Forest machine learning-based vulnerability model using CDC's sociodemographic and COVID-19-specific themes. An innovative ‘COVID-19 Impact Assessment’ algorithm was also developed for evaluating severity of the pandemic and to train the vulnerability model. Developed C19VI was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI and the census data, we explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes. Our index indicates that 575 counties (45 million people) fall into the ‘very high’ vulnerability class, 765 counties (66 million people) in the ‘high’ vulnerability class, and 1435 counties (204 million people) in the ‘moderate’ or ‘low’ vulnerability class. Only 367 counties (20 million people) were found as ‘very low’ vulnerable areas. Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 524 counties with a racial minority population higher than 13% and 420 counties with poverty higher than 20% are in the ‘very high’ or ‘high’ vulnerability classes. The C19VI aims at helping public health officials and disaster management agencies to develop effective mitigation strategies especially for the disproportionately impacted communities.
